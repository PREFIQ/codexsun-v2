# CODEXSUN Assist Pack

## Purpose

CODEXSUN is a SaaS business application platform for multi-tenant, multi-industry, multi-app, multi-port, and multi-container business systems inside one codebase.

This `assist/` folder is the working knowledge base for humans and AI agents who plan, design, review, and build CODEXSUN. It contains product scope, architecture principles, module boundaries, agent behavior rules, versioning notes, and change history.

The goal is to keep the platform clean, scalable, modular, and understandable while supporting many industries, deployment styles, customizations, and online/offline business workflows.

The second goal is to make AI-assisted development practical. CODEIT should be able to read these notes, understand the product direction, and help build features quickly without weakening enterprise safety.

## Product Vision

CODEXSUN should become a business operating platform where each customer receives an isolated, customizable system that matches their industry, billing flow, compliance needs, and growth stage.

It must support:

- Multi-tenant SaaS with strong tenant isolation.
- One database per tenant where required.
- Multiple industries from the same codebase.
- Multiple business apps connected as plug-and-play modules.
- Online, offline, and sync-enabled workflows.
- Centralized design system, authentication, accounts, billing, tasks, mail, activities, notifications, and integrations.
- Indian accounting, GST, e-invoice, e-way bill, and compliance-first business operations.
- Desktop, web, and mobile experiences.
- AI-assisted development through CODEIT.
- AI business assistance through ZERO.

## Core Architecture Direction

CODEXSUN follows a scalable modular monolith architecture with Domain-Driven Design, event-driven workflows, queue management, offline synchronization, and deployable container boundaries.

The codebase should feel like one product, but each app and industry domain must have clear boundaries so it can be developed, tested, activated, deployed, and extended independently.

Primary architecture ideas:

- Modular monolith first, distributed deployment ready.
- Domain-Driven Design for business areas.
- Event-driven communication between modules.
- Queue-backed background processing.
- Tenant-aware data access everywhere.
- Offline-first capable modules where business flow requires it.
- Runtime subscription and feature activation.
- Industry-specific modules layered on top of shared platform services.
- Plugin-style app and integration registration.
- Centralized UI and experience standards.

Enterprise architecture ideas:

- Dedicated tenant databases where needed.
- Optional dedicated containers for large tenants.
- Multi-company, multi-branch, warehouse, counter, and device-aware design.
- Strong audit, backup, restore, monitoring, and support workflows.
- Observable APIs, queues, events, sync, integrations, and AI tools.
- Quality gates for planning, build, review, release, and hotfixes.

## Supported Industries

CODEXSUN must support multiple industries through industry packs. Initial examples include:

- Software services and product companies.
- Garments manufacturing.
- Garments billing and retail.
- uPVC manufacturing and sales.
- Offset printing.
- POS billing.
- General trading and distribution.
- Service billing.
- Other future industries through extension packs.

Each industry can define its own:

- Workflows.
- Billing rules.
- Tax and compliance behavior.
- Documents and print formats.
- Masters and transactions.
- Reports and dashboards.
- Role permissions.
- Offline needs.
- Integrations.

## Platform Apps

CODEXSUN should include common platform apps that are shared across industries:

- Authentication and identity.
- Tenant management.
- User, role, and permission management.
- Subscription, activation, and license control.
- Common master data.
- Mail and notification center.
- Task manager.
- Activities and audit trail.
- Calendar and reminders.
- File and document management.
- External API management.
- Integration hub.
- WhatsApp integration.
- Telegram integration.
- Billing engine.
- Accounting engine.
- Compliance engine.
- Reporting and analytics.
- Offline sync manager.
- Queue and job manager.
- AI assistant layer.

## Tenant Model

Every tenant must be treated as an isolated business unit.

Tenant isolation requirements:

- Each tenant has its own identity, settings, users, roles, subscriptions, features, and customizations.
- Each tenant can have a dedicated database where needed.
- Tenant context must be explicit in backend, frontend, queues, jobs, events, logs, and integrations.
- No module may read or write business data without tenant context.
- Tenant-specific configuration must not leak into global platform configuration.
- Tenant data export, backup, restore, and migration should be planned from the beginning.

## Customization Model

Each tenant may need custom business behavior without damaging the platform core.

Customization should be handled through:

- Feature flags.
- Runtime settings.
- Industry configuration.
- Tenant overrides.
- Plugin modules.
- Custom forms and fields.
- Custom print templates.
- Custom workflows.
- Custom reports.
- Integration adapters.

Avoid direct tenant-specific changes inside shared platform code unless the change is promoted into a generic extension point.

## Offline And Sync

CODEXSUN must support offline-to-online workflows for desktop, web where possible, and mobile.

Offline support should cover:

- Local data cache.
- Tenant-scoped offline store.
- Sync queue.
- Conflict detection.
- Conflict resolution rules.
- Retry and recovery.
- Audit history.
- Background sync.
- Clear user status for pending, synced, failed, and conflicted records.

Offline sync must be designed per module. Accounting, inventory, billing, and compliance records need stricter rules than simple task or note records.

## Billing And Accounting

Billing is centralized but industry-aware.

The billing engine must support:

- Industry-specific invoice flows.
- GST invoices.
- e-Invoice.
- e-Way bill.
- POS billing.
- Garments billing.
- Manufacturing billing.
- Service billing.
- Credit notes and debit notes.
- Payment tracking.
- Print formats.
- Round-off, discounts, tax slabs, and charges.

Accounting should be Tally-like and suitable for Indian businesses.

Accounting must support:

- Ledgers.
- Groups.
- Vouchers.
- Journals.
- Receipts.
- Payments.
- Contra.
- Sales and purchase accounting.
- GST reports.
- Trial balance.
- Balance sheet.
- Profit and loss.
- Cash flow.
- Bank reconciliation.
- Financial year handling.
- Audit trail.
- Compliance exports.

## AI Strategy

CODEXSUN has two AI assistants with different purposes.

CODEIT is a personal development assistant for planning, writing, reviewing, and improving code. It should support multiple modes and multiple models through a clean interface.

ZERO is a business companion inside CODEXSUN. It helps users understand business data, find records, summarize activity, detect risks, predict trends, and recommend actions.

Both assistants must follow tenant security, permission rules, audit requirements, and clear boundaries.

## Technology Pack

Preferred technology stack:

- Node.js.
- TypeScript.
- Fastify.
- React.
- Tailwind CSS.
- shadcn/ui.
- TanStack Query.
- TanStack Table.
- MariaDB.
- Docker.
- Electron for desktop.
- React Native with Expo for mobile.

Technology choices should support modular development, type safety, clean boundaries, scalable deployment, offline workflows, and developer productivity.

## Enterprise Standard

CODEXSUN should be enterprise-ready without becoming heavy for small customers.

Enterprise readiness means:

- Secure tenant isolation.
- Permission-aware workflows.
- Audit trails for important activity.
- Reliable billing, accounting, and compliance records.
- Recoverable queues and integrations.
- Tested backup and restore.
- Clear release and support process.
- Performance planning for large tenants.
- Observability across runtime services.
- AI assistants governed by the same rules as the application.

## Vibe Coding Standard

Vibe coding is allowed and encouraged when it stays inside the CODEXSUN guardrails.

Good vibe coding means:

- Clear intent before changes.
- Small focused edits.
- Existing patterns first.
- Tenant, permission, subscription, and offline impact checked.
- Tests added around risky behavior.
- Docs updated when product meaning changes.
- Clean summary after work.

Use `assist/agents/vibe-coding.md`, `assist/agents/codeit-workflows.md`, `assist/governance/engineering-standards.md`, and `assist/governance/quality-gates.md` as the working standard for AI-assisted development.

## Working Principle

CODEXSUN should stay simple at the center and flexible at the edges.

Shared platform services should be stable and predictable. Industry modules, tenant customizations, integrations, and AI tools should extend the platform without breaking the core.
