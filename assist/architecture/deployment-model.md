# Deployment Model

## Deployment Goal

CODEXSUN should support flexible deployment while keeping development simple.

The platform should run as a modular monolith by default, with container boundaries prepared for scaling and tenant-specific deployment needs.

Local testing and cloud deployment should follow the same strict rules and service boundaries wherever practical.

## Runtime Surfaces

- Web application.
- API server.
- Background workers.
- Queue processor.
- Scheduler.
- Desktop app through Electron.
- Mobile app through Expo.
- Tenant databases.
- File storage.
- Integration services.

## Multi-Port And Multi-Container Direction

Different runtime parts may run on different ports and containers:

- Frontend web app.
- Backend API.
- Worker service.
- Scheduler service.
- Tenant database containers.
- Local development services.
- Integration bridge services where needed.

## Container Rules

- Containers should be replaceable and reproducible.
- Runtime configuration should come from environment variables or secure config.
- Secrets must not be stored in images.
- Logs should be structured.
- Health checks should be available.
- Workers and API should share the same domain contracts.
- Local and cloud containers should use matching contracts, health checks, environment names, and service responsibilities.

## Tenant Deployment Options

Possible tenant deployment models:

- Shared app containers with dedicated tenant database.
- Dedicated app and database containers for selected tenants.
- Hybrid local desktop plus cloud sync.
- On-premise private deployment if business requires it.

## Scaling Direction

Scale in this order:

1. Optimize module and database design.
2. Separate workers from API.
3. Scale read-heavy reporting separately.
4. Add dedicated containers for heavy modules.
5. Split services only when module boundaries are proven.
